## ‚ú® Why diff2ai?

Most AI reviews are noisy. diff2ai generates a focused prompt from your actual diff, with a strict schema that forces actionable feedback (severity, file/line ranges, proposed fix). Paste it into your favorite AI coding agent and get a concise, useful review.

## üì¶ Installation

Requirements

- Node.js >= 18

Global install (recommended)

```bash
npm i -g diff2ai
diff2ai --version   # verify (e.g., 0.0.3)
```

Use without installing (npx)

```bash
npx diff2ai --help
```

Upgrade to latest

```bash
npm i -g diff2ai@latest
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

```bash
# Generate AI-ready prompt for your MR against main
git fetch origin main
diff2ai review feature/my-branch --target main --copy

# Optional: let diff2ai switch to the branch for you (repo will remain on it)
diff2ai review feature/my-branch --target main --copy --switch --fetch

# Paste the generated prompt from your clipboard into Claude, Cursor, or Copilot
```

## üß∞ CLI at a glance

- `review <ref>`: end‚Äëto‚Äëend ‚Äî generate a diff from a branch/ref and immediately produce an AI prompt (default template). Add `--copy` to place the prompt on your clipboard. Use `--save-diff` if you also want the raw `.diff` file written.
  - Flags:
    - `--switch` Switch to `<ref>` before running (refuses if dirty/untracked unless `--yes`)
    - `--fetch` Fetch `origin/<target>` and `origin/<ref>` before running
- `prompt <diff>`: render an AI prompt from an existing `.diff` file.
  - Flags:
    - `--template <nameOrPath>` Use a template by name (from project `./templates/`) or a direct `.md` file path (absolute or relative)
    - `--templates-dir <dir>` Directory to resolve named templates from (defaults to project `./templates/`)
- `diff [--staged]`: write a `.diff` from your working tree (or staged changes).
- `show <sha>`: write a `.diff` for a specific commit.
- `chunk <diff>`: split a large `.diff` into `batch_*.md` files + index.

Global flags (MVP):

- `--no-interactive` Disable prompts (for CI/non‚ÄëTTY)
- `--yes` Auto‚Äëconfirm safe prompts

## üé¨ Demos

<details>
<summary>Show demos</summary>

Review a branch (auto‚Äëprompt + copy to clipboard):

```bash
diff2ai review feature/payments --copy
# writes:
#  - review_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss-SSS.md  (default template)
#  - copies prompt content to your clipboard
#  - add --save-diff to also write review_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss-SSS.diff
# Recommended for AI agents (Cursor/Claude):
# Ensure the tool is on the branch being reviewed and fetch refs
diff2ai review feature/payments --target main --copy --switch --fetch
```

Pick a template explicitly:

```bash
diff2ai review feature/api --template default
# or a minimal one
diff2ai review feature/api --template basic
# or your own project template (./templates/my-template.md)
diff2ai review feature/api --template my-template
# or via direct file path
diff2ai review feature/api --template ./templates/my-template.md
# specify a custom templates directory
diff2ai review feature/api --templates-dir ./my-templates --template code-review
```

Work from an existing diff:

```bash
diff2ai diff --staged         # produce staged_*.diff
diff2ai prompt staged_*.diff  # produce staged_*.md (uses default template)
# with a custom template
diff2ai prompt staged_*.diff --template my-template
# To save the AI response yourself, use native OS commands, e.g. on macOS:
# pbpaste > reviews/review_response.md
```

Handle big diffs:

```bash
diff2ai chunk huge.diff --profile generic-medium
# writes batch_*.md and review_index.md (merge instructions included)
```

 </details>

## üß± The default template (strict)

The default template enforces a clean, repeatable review structure. AI reviewers must output only numbered issue blocks ‚Äî no preambles, no conclusions, no diff echo.

Issue block schema:

```text
## <n>) Severity: CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW|INFO | Type: Implementation|Bug|Security|Test|Performance|Style|Doc|Maintainability
Title: <short imperative>

Affected:
- path/to/file.ext:lineStart-lineEnd

Explanation:
<what is wrong, why it matters, how to fix>

Proposed fix:
~~~<lang>
<minimal snippet or steps>
~~~
```

For chunked reviews: ‚ÄúDo not assume context outside this chunk; if cross‚Äëfile risks are suspected, note briefly.‚Äù

Templates available:

- `default` (strict, recommended)
- `basic` (lightweight)

## üß™ Example output

```text
## 1) Severity: HIGH | Type: Implementation
Title: Avoid mutation of request body in middleware

Affected:
- src/middleware/auth.ts:42-57

Explanation:
Mutating the incoming request object can introduce side effects across downstream handlers. Use a cloned object or limit changes to a derived value.

Proposed fix:
~~~ts
const sanitized = { ...req.body, password: undefined };
next();
~~~
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Output files

- Default output location: current working directory.
- Recommended: use a dedicated `reviews/` directory and add it to `.gitignore`.

- `*.md` AI‚Äëready prompt (paste into your AI coding agent)
- `*.diff` unified diff (optional for `review` via `--save-diff`; always produced by `diff`/`show`)
- `batch_*.md` chunked prompts for large diffs
- `review_index.md` guidance for merging batch results into a single review

```bash
diff2ai review feature/api --target main --save-diff
# writes reviews/*.md and reviews/*.diff (with --save-diff)
```

Paste the generated `*.md` into the MR/PR description or as a top comment.
Use the prompt with your AI reviewer. Save the AI‚Äôs response locally with `diff2ai pasteback` and commit or share as needed.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & behavior

- Preflight checks warn about dirty/untracked files, stash, and divergence.
- Interactive prompts guide target selection; non‚Äëinteractive mode stays quiet.
- No destructive actions are taken without explicit confirmation.
- `--switch` will refuse to change branches if the working tree is dirty or has untracked files unless you pass `--yes`. The repository remains on `<ref>` after completion.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create `.aidiff.json` (JSON5 supported):

```json5
{
  target: 'main', // default target branch
  profile: 'generic-medium', // default chunking profile
  include: ['src/**', 'apps/**'],
  exclude: ['**/*.lock', 'dist/**', '**/*.min.*'],
  // Optional: default template config
  // Use a name (resolved from project ./templates by default) or a file path
  template: 'my-template',
  // Optional: where to resolve named templates from (defaults to ./templates)
  templatesDir: './templates',
}
```

Ignore paths in `.aidiffignore` (minimatch):

```
**/*.lock
**/dist/**
**/*.min.*
```

Profiles (token budgets):

- `claude-large` ‚âà 150k tokens
- `generic-large` ‚âà 100k tokens
- `generic-medium` ‚âà 30k tokens

## üßØ Troubleshooting

- Templates directory not found
  - Fixed in >= 0.0.2. Update to latest: `npm i -g diff2ai@latest`.
  - If developing locally, ensure `npm run build` copied `templates/` into `dist/templates/`.
  - Project-local `templates/` in your CWD are also supported.

- Custom template not found
  - When using a name (e.g., `--template my-template`), diff2ai looks for `./templates/my-template.md` by default, or under `--templates-dir`/`templatesDir` if provided.
  - You can also pass a direct path: `--template ./my-templates/review.md`.

- "Missing required placeholder {diff_content}"
  - Your custom template must include `{diff_content}` where you want the unified diff injected.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Ways to help:

- Improve templates and review schema
- Enhance chunking heuristics and performance
- Add tests and fixtures for edge cases
- Polish CLI UX and docs

Dev setup:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Conventional flow:

1. Fork & branch (small, focused changes)
2. Add tests when adding features/fixing bugs
3. Keep files < 300 lines where practical
4. Ensure `npm test` and `npm run lint` pass
5. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots/terminal output when relevant

## ‚ùì FAQ

- ‚ÄúWhy did `chunk` produce only one file?‚Äù
  - Your diff likely fits within the selected profile‚Äôs token budget; that‚Äôs expected.
- ‚ÄúWhere do I put the AI‚Äôs response?‚Äù
  - Wherever you prefer: PR comments, a `review.md` file, or your internal tools.
- ‚ÄúCan I script this in CI?‚Äù
  - Yes. Use `--no-interactive` (and `--yes` if needed).

- ‚ÄúDoes this upload my code anywhere?‚Äù
  - No. It runs 100% locally and writes to your filesystem. You decide what to paste into an AI.
- ‚ÄúHow do I handle huge MRs?‚Äù
  - Use `diff2ai chunk <diff> --profile <name>`, paste each `batch_*.md` to your AI, then merge the results guided by `review_index.md`.
- ‚ÄúCan I use this on GitLab MRs?‚Äù
  - Yes. Checkout the MR branch locally (or fetch the refs), then run `diff2ai review <branch> --target <base>`.
